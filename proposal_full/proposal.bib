abstract = {In the present study, considering the physical conditions that are relevant in interactions between supernova remnants (SNRs) and dense molecular clouds for triggering star formation we have built a diagram of SNR radius versus cloud density in which the constraints above delineate a shaded zone where star formation is allowed. We have also performed fully 3-D radiatively cooling numerical simulations of the impact between SNRs and clouds under different initial conditions in order to follow the initial steps of these interactions. We determine the conditions that may lead either to cloud collapse and star formation or to complete cloud destruction and find that the numerical results are consistent with those of the SNR-cloud density diagram. Finally, we have applied the results above to the {\$}\backslashbeta-{\$}Pictoris stellar association which is composed of low mass Post-T Tauri stars with an age of 11 Myr. It has been recently suggested that its formation could have been triggered by the shock wave produced by a SN explosion localized at a distance of about 62 pc that may have occurred either in the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) or in the Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL) which are both nearby older subgroups of that association (Ortega and co-workers). Using the results of the analysis above we have shown that the suggested origin for the young association at the proposed distance is plausible only for a very restricted range of initial conditions for the parent molecular cloud, i.e., a cloud with a radius of the order of 10 pc and density of the order of 20 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} and a temperature of the order of 50{\$}-{\$}100 K.},

abstract = {We present a simulation of the formation of the earliest Population II stars, starting from cosmological initial conditions and ending when metals created in the first supernovae are incorporated into a collapsing gas cloud. This occurs after a supernova blast-wave collides with a nearby mini-halo, inducing further turbulence that efficiently mixes metals into the dense gas in the centre of the halo. The gas that first collapses has been enriched to a metallicity of Z ˜ 2 × 10-5 Z⊙. Due to the extremely low metallicity, collapse proceeds similarly to metal-free gas until dust cooling becomes efficient at high densities, causing the cloud to fragment into a large number of low-mass objects. This external enrichment mechanism provides a plausible origin for the most metal-poor stars observed, such as SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, that appear to have formed out of gas enriched by a single supernova. This mechanism operates on shorter time-scales than the time for low-mass mini-haloes (M ≤ 5 × 105 M⊙) to recover their gas after experiencing a supernova. As such, metal-enriched stars will likely form first via this channel if the conditions are right for it to occur. We identify a number of other externally enriched haloes that may form stars in this manner. These haloes have metallicities as high as 0.01 Z⊙, suggesting that some members of the first generation of metal-enriched stars may be hiding in plain sight in current stellar surveys.},

abstract = {Galactic winds exhibit a multiphase structure that consists of hot-diffuse and cold-dense phases. Here we present high-resolution idealised simulations of the interaction of a hot supersonic wind with a cold cloud with the moving-mesh code arepo in setups with and without radiative cooling. We demonstrate that cooling causes clouds with sizes larger than the cooling length to fragment in two- and three-dimensional simulations (2D and 3D). We confirm earlier 2D simulations by McCourt et al. 2018 and highlight differences of the shattering processes of 3D clouds that are exposed to a hot wind. The fragmentation process is quantified with a friends-of-friends analysis of shattered cloudlets and density power spectra. Those show that radiative cooling causes the power spectral index to gradually increase when the initial cloud radius is larger than the cooling length and with increasing time until the cloud is fully dissolved in the hot wind. A resolution of around 1 pc is required to reveal the effect of cooling-induced fragmentation of a 100 pc outflowing cloud. Thus, state-of-the-art cosmological zoom simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) fall short by orders of magnitudes from resolving this fragmentation process.

This observational fact poses a severe challenge to our theoretical models of galaxy evolution since most feedback mechanisms (e.g., supernovae feedback) accelerate hot gas, and the timescale it takes to accelerate a blob of cold gas via a hot wind is much larger than the time it takes to destroy the blob. We revisit this long-standing problem using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling. Our results confirm previous findings, that cooling is often not efficient enough to prevent the destruction of cold gas. However, we also identify regions of parameter space where the cooling efficiency of the mixed, `warm' gas is sufficiently large to contribute new comoving cold gas which can significantly exceed the original cold gas mass. This happens whenever, {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cool, mix{\}}{\}}/t{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cc{\}}{\}} {\textless} 1{\$}, where {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cool,mix{\}}{\}}{\$} is the cooling time of the mixed warm gas and {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cc{\}}{\}}{\$} is the cloud-crushing time.

abstract = {The existence of fast moving, cold gas ubiquitously observed in galactic winds is theoretically puzzling, since the destruction time of cold gas is much smaller than its acceleration time. In Gronke {\&} Oh (2018), we showed that cold gas can accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative cooling time of mixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this process in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and growth in a wide variety of scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining entrainment of hot gas onto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks when the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the cold gas sound speed, and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is also robust to the background wind and initial cloud geometry. In an adiabatic Chevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is constant. Although growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology changes dramatically, with low density, magnetically supported filaments which have a small mass fraction but dominate by volume. This could bias absorption line observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling hot gas can potentially account for the cold gas content of the CGM. It can also fuel star formation in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and cools halo gas. We speculate that galaxy-scale simulations should converge in cold gas mass once cloud column densities of {\$}{\{}\backslashrm N{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}18{\}} \backslash {\{}\backslashrm cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\}}{\$} are resolved.},

abstract = {The elemental-abundance signatures of the very first stars are imprinted on the atmospheres of CEMP-no stars, as various evidence suggests they are bona-fide second-generation stars. It has recently been recognized that the CEMP-no stars can be sub-divided into at least two groups, based on their distinct morphology in the {\$}A{\$}(C)-[Fe/H] space, indicating the likely existence of multiple pathways for their formation. In this work, we compare the halo CEMP-no group morphology with that of stars found in satellite dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way -- a very similar {\$}A{\$}(C)-[Fe/H] pattern is found, providing clear evidence that halo CEMP-no stars were indeed accreted from their host mini-halos, similar in nature to those that formed in presently observed ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We also infer that the previously noted "anomalous" CEMP-no halo stars (with high {\$}A{\$}(C) and low [Ba/Fe] ratios) that otherwise would be associated with Group I may have the same origin as the Group III CEMP-no halo stars, by analogy with the location of several Group III CEMP-no stars in the UFDs and dSphs and their distinct separation from that of the CEMP-{\$}s{\$} stars in the {\$}A{\$}(Ba)-{\$}A{\$}(C) space. Interestingly, CEMP-no stars associated with UFDs include both Group II and Group III stars, while the more massive dSphs appear to have only Group II stars. We conclude that understanding the origin of the CEMP-no halo stars requires knowledge of the masses of their parent mini-halos, which is related to the amount of carbon dilution prior to star formation, in addition to the nature of their nucleosynthetic origin.},

abstract = {We propose and apply a new classification for the CEMP-no stars, which are "carbon-enhanced metal-poor" stars with no overabundance of s-elements and with [Fe/H] generally inferior or equal to -2.5. This classification is based on the changes in abundances for the elements and isotopes involved in the CNO, Ne-Na, and Mg-Al nuclear cycles. These abundances change very much owing to successive back and forth mixing motions between the He- and H-burning regions in massive stars (the "source stars" responsible for the chemical enrichment of the CEMP-no stars). The wide variety of the ratios [C/Fe], 12C/13C, [N/Fe], [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Sr/Fe], and [Ba/Fe], which are the main characteristics making the CEMP-no and low s stars so peculiar, is described well in terms of the proposed nucleosynthetic classification. We note that the [(C+N+O)/Fe] ratios significantly increase for lower values of [Fe/H]. The classification of CEMP-no stars and the behavior of [(C+N+O)/Fe] support the presence, in the first stellar generations of the Galaxy, of fast-rotating massive stars experiencing strong mixing and mass loss (spinstars). This result has an impact on the early chemical and spectral evolution of the Galaxy.},

abstract = {We present realistic models for massive Population III stars and stellar populations based on non-LTE model atmospheres, recent stellar evolution tracks and up-to-date evolutionary synthesis models, with the aim to study their spectral properties, including their dependence on age, star formation history, and IMF. A comparison of plane parallel non-LTE model atmospheres and comoving frame calculations shows that even in the presence of some putative weak mass loss, the ionising spectra of metal-free populations differ little or negligibly from those obtained using plane parallel non-LTE models. As already discussed by Tumlinson {\&} Shull (2000), the main salient property of Pop III stars is their increased ionising flux, especially in the He+ continuum ({\textgreater}54 eV). The main result obtained for individual Pop III stars is the following: due to their redward evolution off the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) the spectral hardness measured by the He+/H ionising flux is decreased by a factor ∼2 when averaged over their lifetime. If such stars would suffer strong mass loss, their spectral appearance could, however, remain similar to that of their ZAMS position. The main results regarding integrated stellar populations are: – for young bursts and the case of a constant SFR, nebular continuous emission – neglected in previous studies – dominates the spectrum redward of Lyman-$\alpha$ if the escape fraction of ionising photons out of the considered region is small or negligible. In consequence predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in earlier studies, whereas the detection of the continuum is eased. Nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric properties of Pop III objects; – due to the redward stellar evolution and short lifetimes of the most massive stars, the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreases rapidly, leading to the disappearance of the characteristic He ii recombination lines after ∼3 Myr in instantaneous bursts; – He ii $\lambda$1640, H$\alpha$ (and other) line luminosities usable as indicators of the star formation rate are given for the case of a constant SFR. For obvious reasons such indicators depend strongly on the IMF; – due to an increased photon production and reduced metal yields, the relative efficiency of ionising photon energy to heavy element rest mass production, $\eta$, of metal-poor and metal-free populations is increased by factors of ∼4 to 18 with respect to solar metallicity and for “standard” IMFs; – the lowest values of $\eta$ ∼ 1.6–2.2{\%} are obtained for IMFs exclusively populated with high mass stars (Mlow {\textgreater}∼ 50 M ). If correct, the yields dominated by pair creation SNae then predict large overabundances of O/C and Si/C compared to solar abundance ratios. Detailed results are given in tabular form and as fit formulae for easy implementation in other calculations. The predicted spectra will be used to study the detectability of Pop III galaxies and to derive optimal search strategies for such objects.},

In order to meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at http://yt.enzotools.org/), an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation and topologically-connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}c h{\^{}}2 = 0.120\backslashpm 0.001{\$}, baryon density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}b h{\^{}}2 = 0.0224\backslashpm 0.0001{\$}, scalar spectral index {\$}n{\_}s = 0.965\backslashpm 0.004{\$}, and optical depth {\$}\backslashtau = 0.054\backslashpm 0.007{\$} (in this abstract we quote {\$}68\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence regions on measured parameters and {\$}95\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to {\$}0.03\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} precision, with {\$}100\backslashtheta{\_}*=1.0411\backslashpm 0.0003{\$}. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant {\$}H{\_}0 = (67.4\backslashpm 0.5){\$}km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m = 0.315\backslashpm 0.007{\$}; and matter fluctuation amplitude {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 = 0.811\backslashpm 0.006{\$}. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} = 2.99\backslashpm 0.17{\$}, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {\$}\backslashsum m{\_}\backslashnu{\textless} 0.12{\$}eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM at over {\$}2\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

@article{Hahn2011,
abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS relative errors of order 10{\^{}}(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

The code is Cartesian, can be run in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly, self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas chemistry, optically-thin radiative cooling of primordial and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a cosmological context. In addition to explaining the algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code development methodology.},
